              Hi there! I'm Mostafa, a front-end developer with a passion for bringing ideas to life.
              My journey into coding began in 2021, and since then, I've focused on mastering the art of front-end development. 
              I enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into polished, responsive, and visually appealing applications that function well and provide a great user experience. 
            </p>
           
            <p>
              I've worked on various projects, from personal websites to complex platforms, with a focus on creating seamless user experiences.
              You can explore my <Link to="/archive" className='about-link'>full projects list here</Link>. 
              As a self-taught developer, I've honed my skills through dedication and a passion for learning.

            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with new tools, contributing to open-source projects, and exploring ways to refine my skills.
