        <p>Hello! My name is Mostafa, and I'm a self-taught software developer passionate about creating things that live on the Internet.  
           I started learning how to code with zero experience and quickly discovered my love for programming.<br/>
           I enjoy the process of taking an idea and turning it into a functioning application. <br/>
           Through personal projects and online courses, I have developed expertise in the frontend field.
        </p>
        <p>    
           I'm eager to collaborate with others and contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference in the user's experience.
           I'm always willing to learn and grow as a software developer. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field, and I am dedicated to enhancing my skills through continuous learning and professional development.
        </p>
