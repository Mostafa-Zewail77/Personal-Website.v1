          Hi there! I'm Mostafa, a self-taught software developer with a passion for bringing ideas to life on the Internet.
          I started my coding journey from scratch and fell in love with programming along the way. 
          There's something incredibly satisfying about turning ideas into real, working applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise lies in front-end development, especially with React JS. 
          I've built a variety of projects and I'm always eager to learn and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in the power of collaboration. Whether working with clients or teaming up with colleagues, I enjoy the process of working together to create solutions that make a difference.
          I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow my skill set and contribute to successful projects.
        </p>
